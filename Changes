Revision history for Perl module IO::Framed

0.01 Fri Mar 31 2017
    - first release

0.011 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Compile/sanity fixes

0.012 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - instead of “input”/“output” in accessors,
      use “read”/“write” since those are the module and method names
      and should thus be easier to remember.

0.013 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Fix ReadWrite modules to actually work. :-/

0.014 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Add no-op stub queue methods to Write::Blocking so that
      applications don’t need to care whether a given IO object
      is blocking or not.

0.015 Sat Apr 1 2017
    - Fixes for tests on Linux
